# Introduction:
This Data Analysis notebook offers an accessible introduction to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using the Netflix Userbase Dataset. Utilizing Seaborn's capabilities, we delve into gender distribution, age demographics, subscription types, and more to extract essential insights.

 The notebook serves as an entry point for beginners to gain hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization, introducing them to the powerful Python library commonly used for data exploration.
